* User-friendly interface: Easy-to-use and navigate.
* Location search: Search for any city and get instant weather details.

  
### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

* An IDE (like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, etc.)
* Python (for Python-based projects)
* Open Weather Map
* HTTP Request
  
### Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

### 1.Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WeatherApp.git

### 2.Navigate to the project directory:
cd WeatherApp
### 3.Install necessary packages (the command might vary depending on your project setup):
pip install -r requirements.txt
### 4.Start the application:
python app.py

### Usage
Provide instructions on how to use the application, including any CLI commands or user interface navigation.

# Basic Setup

Choose a programming language and set up a project environment (e.g., Python, Node.js).
Install necessary libraries for making HTTP requests (e.g., requests in Python, axios in Node.js).
# Building the CLI

Create a script that accepts command-line arguments (e.g., city name).
Use these arguments to build the request URL with your API key.
# Fetching and Displaying Data

Make an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
Parse the response (usually JSON) and extract relevant weather data.
Display this data in a user-friendly format in the console.
# Example CLI Command

arduino
Copy code
weather-app --city "New York"
# Error Handling

Include error handling for things like invalid city names or issues with the API.
